OpenGL/C++ iteration of the popular game Plants vs. Zombies. Destroy the Hexagons and defend your base.

## Installation guide (Windows)

## How to play
Mouse only controls.
Drag and drop the diamonds from the top of the screen to the 3x3 green grid of tiles.
A diamond must be of the same color as an incoming hexagon.
Different colored diamonds cost a different number of stars.
Stars spawn every few seconds on the screen. Click on them to add them to your wallet.
You have 3 lives. If a Hexagon reaches the red base, you lose a life.
